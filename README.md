# Road Segmentation using TensorFlow/Keras


This project demonstrates road segmentation using deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to classify road pixels from aerial images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of aerial images and their corresponding ground truth masks. The images are stored in `dataset/training/image_2/` and the masks in `dataset/training/gt_image_2/`.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- tqdm

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
